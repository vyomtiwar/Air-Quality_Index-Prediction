#Air Quality Index Prediction
The main aim of this Project is to Provide real time Information about the air quality of a particular area so that an organisation or individual make informed decisions.
And it helps to indentify the factors that contribute to poor air quality.

In this project I use different python libraries like pandas, seaborn,matplotlib,numpy, SciKit-Learn and different machine Learning Algorithms like linear regression,Lasso and ridge, Decision Tree , random forest and KNN.
Linear Regression and KNN models are best fit gave best performance. Finally, used KNN models to perform predictions.

Deployed the project on web using Streamlit.
